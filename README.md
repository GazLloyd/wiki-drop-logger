# Wiki Drop Logger

Drop logger for the wiki.

## How to Install & Required Settings

To install Action Bar Tracker copy & paste this link into Alt1's browser app:
`alt1://addapp/https://nadyanayme.github.io/wiki-drop-logger/dist/appconfig.json`

If you do not have Alt1 Toolkit installed already you can [download it from runeapps.org](https://runeapps.org/alt1). In order for Wiki Drop Logger to work make sure your Runescape settings for Game and UI Scale settings are set to `100%` as this is required for Alt1 to be able to read your game screen.
